This project has been completed as the final project of the Akbank Python Bootcamp, conducted through the Global AI Hub."
In this project i built the “Library Management System” using object-oriented
programming techniques. This program will use books.txt file that you will create as a database
where each line will represent a single book. At each line, book name, author, release date
and number of pages will be kept and separated with a comma.
There is a class named "Library" in this project and it has 3 methods which are:
